# Teachable Graph
Creating graphs on the Teachable Platform

# Instructions
## Part One - The HTML and JavaScript
* Load up the course sales page (if you need to add this to your school page you'll need to use the Power Editor).
* Create a new section
* Copy the HTML code from the section.html page into your newly created section
* Make any changes to the HTML to match the required graph figures you need
* Click the orange Save button

*You'll notice that the JavaScript code is included at the end of this HTML section. Make sure to keep the surrounding <script></script> tags otherwise the graphs will not be displayed properly.*

## Part Two - The CSS
* Load the custom.css area in your Teachable school - Admin -> Site -> Code Snippets
* Copy the CSS code from the graph.css file below any custom code you already have in the custom.css area.
* Click the orange Save button

Done
